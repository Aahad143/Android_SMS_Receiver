# Data SMS Receiver Demo

This Android app showcases how to receive data SMS on a specific port. 
It includes a BroadcastReceiver that listens for incoming data SMS messages and processes the binary data.

A demo SMPP script for generating the binary SMS can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/yusufk/c95b23a8c1f63d4c0aeadc7217e381aa).
